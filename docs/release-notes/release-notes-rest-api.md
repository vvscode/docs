**Verification:**

We are glad to announce the introduction of our Verification product, which comes packaged with a complete set of SDKs and REST APIs. Complete documentation can be found here:

/docs/verification/ \<verificationdocumentation\>

And the REST APIs in particular:

/docs/verification/rest/ [here](doc:verification-rest-api)

The standalone Flashcall verification API will continue to be supported normally. This API is not part of the new Verification service and will not work with the new SDKs. The documentation can be found here:

[/flash-verification-version-1/](https://www.sinch.com/flash-verification-version-1/)

<h3>Sinch REST API documentation update 20150520</h3>
The SMS Messaging API is now restricted to only send to your verified phone number, for Sandbox apps. To send SMS to all phone numbers, you will need a Production app.

<h3>Sinch REST API documentation update 20150506</h3>
Documentation update:  
-   Fixed an error in the example code for the ICE callback event response
-   Added examples for the SVAML Instructions and Actions

<h3>Sinch REST API documentation update 20150428</h3>
With this release, the following restrictions are applied to the Sinch SMS API for new partners:
- In order to use the Sinch SMS API, you need to have a verified phone number. In order to verify your phone number, login to the Sinch dashboard, click on “Quickstart” and follow the instructions.
- The default CLI used for oubound SMS is now set to the phone number that you have verified in the Sinch dashboard.

<h3>Sinch REST API documentation update 20150401</h3>
This release introduces the support for PSTN origination and text-to-speech.

With PSTN origination, you can now route calls from the PSTN network to any application or any fixed or mobile number. Routing and control can be managed by your backend. For more information, on how to use PSTN origination, please check the documentation [here](doc:voice-rest-api-calling-api).

Text to speech, abbreviated as TTS, is a form of speech synthesis that converts text into spoken voice output. With this functionality, an application can instruct the Sinch calling service to read out a particular text message in a voice call. For more information please check the documentation [here](doc:voice-rest-api-calling-api#section-text-to-speech).

<h3>Sinch REST API documentation update 20150324</h3>
Changed the verification status that is returned when querying the status of a flashcall verification and the respective result in the flashcall verification CDRs. They now are set to “N/A” because the Sinch verification service has very limited visibility on the result of a verification request. This field will be used again when the Sinch Verification SDK is used.

<h3>Sinch REST API documentation update 20150211</h3>
With this release, Sinch is introducing a new way of verifying phone numbers: Flash-calling. With the Sinch API, a developer can place a flash-call (“missed call”) to a phone number of a user, and check in the user’s app if the phone was received with a particular caller number. For more information please check our documentation [here](doc:verification-rest-api).

<h3>Sinch REST API documentation update 20150120</h3>
This release adds support for some new parameters in the Calling Callback events ICE and DiCE.

> 1.  In the ICE event, a new parameter “userRate” is added. It shows the current rate of the particular call, if the call is of “PSTN” type.
> 2.  In the DiCE event, there are 2 new parameters: “userRate”, which shows the rate of the particular call, and “debit” which shows how much was charged for the call.

<h3>Sinch REST API Documentation update 20141217</h3>

Calling API documentation update:

> -   Included the CANCEL reason code in the response of the DiCE event, the getCallResult API and in the CDRs. The CANCEL reason is returned when the caller initiated the call and cancelled it.
