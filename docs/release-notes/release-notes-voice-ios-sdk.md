<h3>2015/02/23 | Sinch SDK iOS 3.4.2</h3>

<h3>2014/11/13 | Sinch SDK iOS 3.2.9</h3>
-   Fixed a regression in reporting SINCallEndCauseNoAnswer even if the call has been cancelled by the caller. It will now report the expected SINCallEndCauseCanceled in this case.

<h3>2014/10/27 | Sinch SDK iOS 3.2.8</h3>

<h3>2014/10/09 | Sinch SDK iOS 3.2.4</h3>
-   Improvements of disposal of Sinch SDK internals if a consumer of the Sinch SDK would accidently keep reference counts on a SINMessageClient even after a -[SINClient terminate] has been called. *IMPORTANT: Do note that is not in any way recommended to keep references to e.g. a SINMessageClient or a SINCallClient after the parent SINClient has been terminated.*
-   Fixed issue if caller hung up call quickly and before the callee answer, the callee would not receive the event that the call actually ended.

<h3>2014/10/03 | Sinch SDK iOS 3.2.3</h3>

<h3>2014/08/05 | Sinch SDK iOS 3.1.5</h3>
-   Bugfix: Incoming calls will from now on never have state SINCallStateProgressing. Previously, incoming calls could either be in SINCallStateInitiating or SINCallStateProgressing just after -[SINCallClientDelgate client:didReceiveIncomingCall:]. Now, the call will initially be in SINCallStateInitiating, until transitioning to SINCallStateEstablished or SINCallStateEnded.
-   Fixed crash when attempting to send DTMF during call setup.
-   Internal improvements for Call headers.
