## The different SMS APIs

### REST
The easiest and most feature-rich API we offer. It allows for single messages, scheduled batch sending, message templates and more. You can also use our server-side libraries if you like to work natively in your programming language of choice.

### SMPP
SMPP interfaces for full control and low latency.

_I have an old integration, where do I find the documentation?_
The guides above are our standard and recommended integration options. However, we do manage platforms where clients have integrated in the past, and we have collected those API guides here if you need them.
