### Send a batch message

The following operation will send a batch message.

Depending on the length of the *body* one message might be [split into multiple parts](doc:sms-rest-message-body#section-long-messages) and charged accordingly.

Any groups targeted in a scheduled batch will be evaluated at the time of sending. If a group is deleted between batch creation and scheduled date it will be considered empty.

### Cancel batch message

A batch can be canceled at any point. If a batch is canceled while it's currently being delivered some messages currently being processed might still be delivered. The delivery report will indicate which messages were canceled and which weren't.

Canceling a batch scheduled in the future will result in an empty delivery report while canceling an already sent batch would result in no change to the completed delivery report.

#### Request

`DELETE /xms/v1/{service_plan_id}/batches/{batch_id}`

#### Response

`200 OK`

The response is a JSON object described in send\_batch\_msg.

**Cancel a batch message**

`404 Not Found`

The batch ID is not known to the system or the recipient is not a target of this batch.

### Receiving delivery report callbacks

Delivery report callbacks will be received for batches where *delivery\_report* parameter is set to *summary*, *full* or *per\_recipient*.

If no *callback\_url* was specified for the batch then the default callback URL for the given service plan will be used.

#### Summary and full

If a batch was created with a request for *full* or *summary* *delivery report* then one callback will be made to the specified callback URL when all messages in the batch (which may be one message) are either delivered, failed or expired. If you want to know the delivery status for a message before all messages are completed then you can always use retrieve\_delivery\_report at any time.

The format for summary and full reports is the same as the retrieve\_delivery\_report response. The difference being that when *full* is requested a list of phone numbers / recipients per delivery status is provided.

#### Per recipient

If a batch was created with a request for *per\_recipient* *delivery\_report* then a callback will be made for each status change of a message. This could result in a lot of callbacks and should be **used with caution for larger batches**. These delivery reports also include a timestamp of when the Delivery Report originated from the SMSC.
