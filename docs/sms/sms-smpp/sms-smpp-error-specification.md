### Overview

This specification covers error codes related to the SMPP communication.

### SMPP connection error codes

All errors on the SMPP connection received in SUBMIT\_SM\_RESP are described in the SMPP Protocol Specification v3.4 Issue 1.2 chapter 5.1.3 command\_status.

### Messages states

A message will always be in one of the following states:

| Message state | Value | Description                                                |
| ------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| ENROUTE       | 1     | Message is in the process of being sent to the destination |
| Delivered     | 2     | Message has been delivered to destination                  |
| EXPIRED       | 3     | Message validity period has expired                        |
| DELETED       | 4     | Message has been deleted                                   |
| UNDELIVERABLE | 5     | Message is undeliverable                                   |
| UNKNOWN       | 7     | Message is in invalid state                                |

The states are described in the SMPP Protocol Specification v3.4 Issue 1.2 chapter 5.2.28 message\_state. The message state value is also attached in a SMPP Optional Parameter “message\_state” value 0x0427 described in the SMPP Protocol Specification v3.4 Issue 1.2 chapter 5.3.2.35.

### Status reports error codes

The error codes are provided in status reports according to the SMPP Protocol Specification v3.4 Issue 1.2 Appendix B. The following are the error codes Sinch Networks will be sending:
