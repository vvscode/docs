## Overview

## The different SMS APIs

### [REST](doc:rest) 
The easiest and most feature-rich API we offer. It allows for single messages, scheduled batch sending, message templates and more. You can also use our server-side libraries if you like to work natively in your programming language of choice. 

### [SMPP](doc:smpp)
SMPP interfaces for full control and low latency. 

## Getting started
Getting started with the Sinch SMS API is simple.
- Create an SMS account in the [Sinch Dasboard](https://dashboard.sinch.com/#/signup "Sinch Dasboard")

_I have an old integration, where do I find the documentation?_
The guides above are our standard and recommended integration options. However, we do manage platforms where clients have integrated in the past, and we have collected those API guides here if you need them.
