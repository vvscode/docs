## Introduction

The REST Messaging API is designed to be a simple and powerful tool for large scale messaging with features such as:

 - Use a convenient HTTP interface.
 - Send a message to more than one recipient in the same request.
 - Send text messages with up to 1600 characters.
 - Organize your frequent recipients into groups.
 - Send messages at a later time with scheduling.
 - Customize your message for each recipient using parameterization.
 - Receive messages from end users with MO support.
 - Automatic default originator selection support for messages without originator.
 - Receive inbound messages and delivery notifications via HTTP or AWS SNS.

## Service plan

To use the REST API you first need to create an HTTP REST Service using the [web dashboard](https://dashboard.sinch.com/#/signup). You can have multiple service plans and each one will see their messages, groups or other resources isolated from each other.

## Authentication

You will be provided with an authentication token for each service plan.

The token is sent in the `Authorization` header preceded by `Bearer`. It is required for all requests made to the REST API.

**Example request with token to send a SMS**

``` shell
curl -X POST \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json"  -d '
      {
          "from": "12345",
          "to": [
              "123456789"
          ],
          "body": "Hi there! How are you?"
      }' \
  "https://eu.sms.api.sinch.com/xms/v1/{service_plan_id}/batches"
```

## Base URL

The following URLs can be used by the REST API. We have servers in the US and EU. By default your account will be created in the US environment. If you'd like access to the European environment, please contact our support team.  


| Server        |  URL                                   |
|---------------|----------------------------------------|
| General API | https://us.sms.api.sinch.com     |
| Geographical APIs | If you want to set one up, contact your account manager     |
| US Production | https://us.sms.api.sinch.com     |
| EU Production | https://eu.sms.api.sinch.com     |

## Rate Limits

Each service plan comes with a rate limit which sets the maximum number of messages that can be sent per second. The rate limit is calculated from all messages sent via the API, so a batch with 10 recipients will count as 10 messages for rate limiting purposes.

Each service plan gets it's own message queue served in First-In-First-Out order. This means that new batches will be accepted immediately but might be delayed if earlier batches are still on queue.

## SMS REST formats

This section will take a brief look at some of the formats used in the REST API.

### JSON

JSON (`application/json`) is the content type of both requests and responses if not otherwise specified.

Requests with invalid JSON will be rejected.

Null values can be omitted in requests and will be omitted in responses. In some cases explicitly setting `null` will overwrite a previously set value with `null`. See [Update a group](doc:sms-rest-groups-endpoint#section-update-a-group) for an example.

> **Note**    
>
> New features might result in additional request and response
> parameters. New request parameters will either have a default value or
> considered optional to retain backwards compatibility. It is highly
> recommended to ignore any unexpected parameters when reading JSON in API responses and in callback handlers.

### MSISDN

Only MSISDNs in international format are accepted by the API.

MSISDNs can be sent in with or without a leading `+` (i.e. `+123456789` or `123456789`) or with a leading `00`. Any space, dash or bracket will also be ignored by the API.

All MSISDNs returned by the REST API will be without a `+` or `00` prefix, even if they were sent in with one.

### Timestamp

Timestamps are used for expressing a moment in time. They are represented using the [ISO-8601 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601). Examples of those are the fields `send_at` and `expire_at` in the [Send a batch message](doc:sms-rest-batches-endpoint#section-send-a-batch-message) operation.

A time offset can be specified in accordance with [ISO-8601 time offsets from UTC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_offsets_from_UTC). If no time offset is specified (_local time_ in ISO-8601) then UTC will be used.

All timestamps returned by the API will be represented in UTC time, with millisecond precision.

## HTTP Status Codes

The REST API returns an HTTP status and code each time a request is made.

### HTTP Statuses

The following HTTP status codes are used by the API. Additional codes might be added in the future and if you encounter a code not in this list please consult the [HTTP specification](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10/) for a definition.

| Status                                    | Description                                                                                                                 |
|-- -                                       | ---                                                                                                                       --|
| 200&nbsp;OK                               | The request was successful.                                                                                                 |
| 201&nbsp;Created                          | The `POST` request was successful and a new resource was created.                                                           |
| 400&nbsp;Bad&nbsp;Request                 | The request does not conform to the API. The response body should provide more information.                                 |
| 401&nbsp;Unauthorized                     | Authentication token is invalid for this service plan.                                                                      |
| 403&nbsp;Forbidden                        | The request syntax is valid but cannot be performed. This could for example be because a referenced resource doesn't exist. |
| 404&nbsp;Not&nbsp;Found                   | The path is invalid or no resource exists with the given ID.                                                                |
| 405&nbsp;Method&nbsp;Not&nbsp;Allowed     | The path is valid but not for this method.                                                                                  |
| 415&nbsp;Unsupported&nbsp;Media&nbsp;Type | The `Content-Type` header is missing or unsupported. Most operations expect `application/json`.                             |
| 429&nbsp;Too&nbsp;Many&nbsp;Requests      | The user or path has too many outstanding requests.                                                                         |
| 500&nbsp;Internal&nbsp;Server&nbsp;Error  | An unexpected internal error occurred and the request was not processed.                                                    |
| 503&nbsp;Service&nbsp;Unavailable         | The service is unable to perform the request at this point. Most likely due to a required subsystem being unavailable.      |


### HTTP Errors

Responses with status `400 Bad Request` and `403 Forbidden` will present a JSON object in the body explaining the error. It has the following structure:

| Name   | Description                                                                                                             | JSON Type |
|-- -    | ---                                                                                                                     | ---     --|
| `code` | A code that can be used to programmatically recognize the error. See [below](#section-error-codes) for possible values. | `String`  |
| `text` | Human readable description of the error. Can be used for debugging.                                                     | `String`  |

### Error codes

The following error codes can be returned as values for the `code` field:

| HTTP Status | Code                              | Description                                                                                                         |
|-- -         | ---                               | ---                                                                                                               --|
| 400         | `syntax_invalid_json`             | The JSON in the request is invalid or does not conform to the API specification.                                    |
| 400         | `syntax_invalid_parameter_format` | The format of a field value is invalid. For example if a MSISDN is not correctly formatted.                         |
| 400         | `syntax_constraint_violation`     | The request body doesn't fulfill all of the constraints set by the API. For example if a required field is missing. |
| 403         | `unknown_group`                   | A referenced group ID is unknown. This could happen if the ID is invalid or if the group has been deleted.          |
| 403         | `unknown_campaign`                | The campaign ID does not match the specified originator.                                                            |
| 403         | `missing_callback_url`            | Callback has been requested but no URL is provided.                                                                 |

## Callback

A callback is a HTTP POST request with a notification made by the Sinch SMS REST API to a URI of your choosing. The REST API expects the receiving server to respond with a response code within the `2xx` Success range. If no successful response is received then the REST API will either schedule a retry if the error is expected to be temporary or discard the callback if the error seems permanent. The first initial retry will happen 5 seconds after the first try. The next attempt is after 10 seconds, then after 20 seconds, after 40 seconds, after 80 seconds and so on, doubling on every attempt. The last retry will be at 81920 seconds (or 22 hours 45 minutes) after the initial failed attempt.

The REST API offers the following callback options which can be configured for your account upon request to your account manager.

 * Callback with mutual authentication over TLS (HTTPS) connection by provisioning the callback URL with client keystore and password.
 * Callback with basic authentication by provisioning the callback URL with username and password.
 * Callback with OAuth 2.0 by provisioning the callback URL with username, password and the URL to fetch OAuth access token.
 * Callback using AWS SNS by provisioning the callback URL with an Access Key ID, Secret Key and Region.

### Delivery report callback

A delivery report contains the status and status code for each recipient of a batch. To get a delivery report callback for a message or batch of messages you need to set the `delivery_report` field accordingly when [creating a batch](doc:sms-rest-batches-endpoint#section-send-a-batch-message). The formats of the different types of delivery reports are described in [Retrieve a delivery report](doc:sms-rest-batches-endpoint#section-retrieve-a-delivery-report) and in [Retrieve a recipient delivery report](doc:sms-rest-batches-endpoint#section-retrieve-a-recipient-delivery-report).

The callback URL can either be provided for each batch in the [Send a batch message](doc:sms-rest-batches-endpoint#section-send-a-batch-message) operation or provisioned globally for your account.

### Inbound message callback

An inbound message or MO (*Mobile Originated*) is a message sent to one of your shortcodes or long numbers from a mobile phone. The format of an inbound callback is described in [Inbounds Endpoint](doc:sms-rest-inbounds-endpoint).

To receive inbound message callbacks, a URL needs to be provisioned for your account. This URL can be specified in the Sinch Dashboard.

## Message Body

When specifying the message body in the request, the characters used as well as the length of the message affect how many actual SMS messages are sent out. When using [parameterization](doc:sms-rest-parameterization), the length of each message may also vary depending on the recipient-specific data.

### Supported Characters

Individual characters used in the message determine the type of encoding that will ultimately be used to send the SMS message. The API automatically detects the encoding required from the characters used, which allows us to support the delivery of SMS in any language.

#### Basic Character Set

You can send up to 160 characters in a single SMS message if all characters in your message are part of the GSM 7-bit character set:

|      |       |      |     |     |     |     |       |
|-- -  | ---   | ---  | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- --|
| @    | Δ     | `SP` | 0   | ¡   | P   | ¿   | p     |
| £    | _     | !    | 1   | A   | Q   | a   | q     |
| $    | Φ     | "    | 2   | B   | R   | b   | r     |
| ¥    | Γ     | #    | 3   | C   | S   | c   | s     |
| è    | Λ     | ¤    | 4   | D   | T   | d   | t     |
| é    | Ω     | %    | 5   | E   | U   | e   | u     |
| ù    | Π     | &    | 6   | F   | V   | f   | v     |
| ì    | Ψ     | '    | 7   | G   | W   | g   | w     |
| ò    | Σ     | (    | 8   | H   | X   | h   | x     |
| Ç    | Θ     | )    | 9   | I   | Y   | i   | y     |
| `LF` | Ξ     | *    | :   | J   | Z   | j   | z     |
| Ø    | `ESC` | +    | ;   | K   | Ä   | k   | ä     |
| ø    | Æ     | ,    | <   | L   | Ö   | l   | ö     |
| `CR` | æ     | -    | =   | M   | Ñ   | m   | ñ     |
| Å    | ß     | .    | >   | N   | Ü   | n   | ü     |
| å    | É     | /    | ?   | O   | §   | o   | à     |

`LF` is the Line Feed character - for JSON format, provide it as `\n`
`SP` is the Space character

#### Extended Character Set

The following characters are also available, but they are counted as two characters in the SMS message rather than one:

`|` , `^` , `€` , `{` , `}` , `[` , `]` , `~` , `\`

#### Other Characters

If other characters are required for different languages, 16-bit Unicode (UCS-2) encoding will be used. When using UCS-2 encoding, each character will take 2 bytes, which means up to 70 characters can be sent per UCS-2 encoded SMS message.

### Long Messages

The message body in a request can contain up to 1600 characters. Longer messages will be split and sent as multiple distinct SMS messages. In most cases, those messages will be re-assembled on the handset and displayed to the end-user as a single long message. You can use the tables below to determine the actual number of SMS messages your message will use depending on its length and encoding.

#### Using only 7-bit Characters

| Message Length | Number of SMS Parts |
|-- -            | ---               --|
| 1 - 160        | 1                   |
| 161 - 306      | 2                   |

| 919 - 1061     | 7                   |
| 1062 - 1214    | 8                   |
| 1215 - 1367    | 9                   |
| 1368 - 1520    | 10                  |
| 1521 - 1600    | 11                  |

Each SMS in a multi-part 7-bit encoded message, has a maximum length of 153 characters.

| 1585 - 1600    | 25                  |

Each SMS in a multi-part Unicode encoded message, has a maximum length of 67
characters.

## Parameterization

Parameterization enables you to customize parts of a message for each recipient.

This is done by defining a *parameter key* and placing it in the message body. For each *parameter key*, a recipient and parameter value must be provided. The position of a parameter in a message is defined by specifying placeholders in the format `${parameter_key}` in the message body, where `parameter_key` is the name of the parameter to replace with its corresponding value.

For example the message body `Hi ${name}! How are you?` contains the parameter `name` and will be replaced according to the rules specified in the `parameters` field in the [Send a batch message](doc:sms-rest-batches-endpoint#section-send-a-batch-message) operation.

A default parameter value can be specified that will be used when an MSISDN is not listed for a particular parameter. To set this, identify a recipient as default for each *parameter key*.

If a target MSISDN is missing in the parameters object and no default value has been defined for that parameter the message will fail for that MSISDN but not for other recipients.

Parameter keys are case sensitive.

## Delivery Reports

The REST API uses message statuses and error codes in delivery reports, which refer to the state of the SMS batch and can be present in either [Retrieve a delivery report](doc:sms-rest-batches-endpoint#section-retrieve-a-delivery-report) or sent to a [callback](doc:sms-rest-callback).

This section describes the statuses and codes returned in those delivery reports.

### Delivery Report Statuses

The status field describes which state a particular message is in. Please note that statuses of type Intermediate will only be reported if you request a status per recipient ([Retrieve a recipient delivery report](doc:sms-rest-batches-endpoint#section-retrieve-a-recipient-delivery-report)), no callback will be made to report them. The following statuses are available when using the REST API:

| Status     | Type         | Description                                                                                                                                   |

### Delivery Report Error Codes

The delivery report status code provides a more detailed view of what happened with a message. The REST API shares most of its error codes with other SMS services.

These are defined [here](doc:sms-other-cloud-smpp#section-error-codes).

In addition to these standard error codes, the REST API provides an additional set of error codes, all within the 4xx range (vendor specific errors in the range of 0x400 to 0x4FF as referenced in the SMPP specification). These are listed below:

| Status Code (Hex) | Name                         | Status     | Description                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 400               | Queued                       | Queued     | Message is queued within REST API system and will be dispatched according to the rate of the account.                               |
| 401               | Dispatched                   | Dispatched | Message has been dispatched to SMSC.                                                                                                |
| 402               | Message unroutable           | Aborted    | SMSC rejected message. Retrying is likely to cause the same error.                                                                  |
| 403               | Internal error               | Aborted    | An unexpected error caused the message to fail.                                                                                     |
| 404               | Temporary delivery failure   | Aborted    | Message failed because of temporary delivery failure. Message can be retried.                                                       |
| 405               | Unmatched Parameter          | Aborted    | One or more parameters in the message body has no mapping for this recipient. See [Parameterization](doc:sms-rest-parameterization) |
| 406               | Internal Expiry              | Aborted    | Message was expired before reaching SMSC. This may happen if the expiry time for the message was very short.                        |
| 407               | Canceled                     | Aborted    | Message was canceled by user before reaching SMSC.                                                                                  |
| 408               | Internal Reject              | Aborted    | SMSC rejected the message. Retrying is likely to cause the same error.                                                              |
| 410               | Unmatched default originator | Aborted    | No default originator exists/configured for this recipient when sending message without originator.                                 |
| 411               | Exceeded parts limit         | Aborted    | Message failed as the number of message parts exceeds the defined max number of message parts.                                      |
| 412               | Unprovisioned region         | Aborted    | SMSC rejected the message. The account has not been provisioned for this region.                                                    |

## Batches Endpoint

### Send a batch message

The following operation will send a batch message.

Depending on the length of the *body* one message might be [split into multiple parts](doc:sms-rest-message-body#section-long-messages) and charged accordingly.

Any groups targeted in a scheduled batch will be evaluated at the time of sending. If a group is deleted between batch creation and scheduled date it will be considered empty.

### Cancel batch message

A batch can be canceled at any point. If a batch is canceled while it's currently being delivered some messages currently being processed might still be delivered. The delivery report will indicate which messages were canceled and which weren't.

Canceling a batch scheduled in the future will result in an empty delivery report while canceling an already sent batch would result in no change to the completed delivery report.

#### Request

`DELETE /xms/v1/{service_plan_id}/batches/{batch_id}`

#### Response

`200 OK`

The response is a JSON object described in send\_batch\_msg.

**Cancel a batch message**

`404 Not Found`

The batch ID is not known to the system or the recipient is not a target of this batch.

### Receiving delivery report callbacks

Delivery report callbacks will be received for batches where *delivery\_report* parameter is set to *summary*, *full* or *per\_recipient*.

If no *callback\_url* was specified for the batch then the default callback URL for the given service plan will be used.

#### Summary and full

If a batch was created with a request for *full* or *summary* *delivery report* then one callback will be made to the specified callback URL when all messages in the batch (which may be one message) are either delivered, failed or expired. If you want to know the delivery status for a message before all messages are completed then you can always use retrieve\_delivery\_report at any time.

The format for summary and full reports is the same as the retrieve\_delivery\_report response. The difference being that when *full* is requested a list of phone numbers / recipients per delivery status is provided.

#### Per recipient

If a batch was created with a request for *per\_recipient* *delivery\_report* then a callback will be made for each status change of a message. This could result in a lot of callbacks and should be **used with caution for larger batches**. These delivery reports also include a timestamp of when the Delivery Report originated from the SMSC.

## Inbounds Endpoint

Inbounds, or Mobile Originated messages, are incoming messages. Inbound messages can be listed and retrieved like batch messages and they can also be delivered by callback requests like delivery reports.

### Update a group

With the update group operation you can add and remove members to an existing group as well as rename the group.

The request will **not** be rejected for duplicate adds or unknown removes.

The adds will be done before the deletes so if an MSISDN is in both lists then it will not be part of the resulting group.

To remove an existing name set name explicitly to the JSON value **null**. Omitting **name** from the JSON body will leave the name unchanged.

Updating a group targeted by a batch message scheduled in the future is allowed and changes will be reflected until the batch is sent.

## Automatic Default Originator

Default originator pool of an account is the set of originators for different countries configured by the account manager, if requested it will be used when batch message has no originator specified (missing "from" parameter).

For each MSISDN the originator will be auto selected from its default originator pool based on the country/region of the MSISDN when submitting a batch with missing originator as in `send_batch_msg` operation, if a default originator pool configured for your account. A batch with multiple recipients of different countries can get different originators based on the configured originator pool of that account.

If no default originator exists for the target MSISDN, then the message will be failed only for that MSISDN and not for the rest of the batch.

## Limiting Message Parts

With max number of message parts you can specify whether the message should be dispatched. If a message is split into more parts than `max_number_of_message_parts` then it will not be delivered and status code will be `411`.

A default `max_number_of_message_parts` can be configured at the account level by your account manager. If the `max_number_of_message_parts` parameter is specified when creating a batch, it will override the default value configured by your account manager.

When `max_number_of_message_parts` parameter is set or the default value is configured, `number_of_message_parts` parameter will be included in recipient delivery report.

## URL Link Previews

Some mobile devices are capable of displaying previews for links contained in SMS or MMS messages. When messages that contain a URL are received on these devices, they may be rendered in the messaging application with a preview of the linked page. This behaviour is controlled from the phone or its software, and can not be affected by Sinch or the carrier.

### Behaviour on iOS

There are multiple factors that affect whether an iPhone shows a preview for a link received in a message, and what the preview looks like:

#### Is the sender saved in the recipient's contacts list?

According to our testing, iOS will only render a preview for links sent in SMS or MMS if the sender is saved in the recipient's contact list. Otherwise, the URL will be displayed in the body of the message.

#### Is the URL at the very beginning or the very end of the message?

iPhones will only display a link preview if the URL is at the beginning or the end of the message. iOS will not render a preview for a URL in the middle of a message, or even just surrounded by periods or quotation marks.

### Behaviour on Android

Depending on the device but if the recipient has googles Messages app or Samsung you should be able to see previews if the phone has been updated after June 2018
