## Overview

### Methods

This API exposes calling-related functionality in the Sinch platform. The following APIs resources are available through the following URLs:

    https://callingapi.sinch.com/[version]
    or
    https://api.sinch.com/calling/[version]

    Current  version is "v1"

    [GET]       /configuration/numbers/
    [POST]      /configuration/numbers/
    [GET]       /configuration/callbacks/applications/{applicationkey}
    [POST]      /configuration/callbacks/applications/{applicationkey}
    [GET]       /calling/query/number/{number}

Other set of APIs provide information and/or control of the calls handled locally in a region. Therefore, the URL to access these APIs is provided as part of the ICE callback, in the `callResourceUrl` property.

## Manage Call

**[Patch] calling/v1/calls/id/{callId}**

This method can be used to manage ongoing, connected calls or to unpark parked calls.

### Request

    [RequestBody]
        SVAML

    [SVAML]
        Instruction[] - instructions
        Action - action

**Important**: This method can only be used for calls that are originating from or terminating to PSTN or SIP networks.

### Managing Ongoing, Connected Calls

For ongoing, connected calls, you can use this endpoint to play messages and/or optionally hang up the call. There are two instructions available to play messages. The *PlayFiles* instruction can be used to play an IVR message, while the *Say* instruction can be used to play a text-to-speech message. The message, if specified, is played only on the caller side. A caller can, for example, hear a message saying the total minutes have expired and that the call will be disconnected.

For more information on playing messages and performing actions on calls see the [Callback API](doc:voice-cloud-callback-api).

### Managing Parked calls

For a parked call (see [Callback API](doc:voice-cloud-callback-api) on how to park a call), this endpoint can be used to “unpark” the call. Parked calls can be considered calls where the ICE response has been “postponed”. When unparking a parked call, you simply provide the SVML you normally would have responded with in the ICE response if you had not “postponed” it -see the [Callback API](doc:voice-cloud-callback-api).
