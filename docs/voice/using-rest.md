  This document outlines how to use the Sinch Voice REST API as well as the
  Sinch Verification REST API. Get more information here.

## Authorization

The API uses the standard HTTP `Authorization` header to pass authentication information.

### Timestamp

The client must send a custom header *x-timestamp* (time) with each request that is validated by the server. This custom header is used to determine that the request is not too old. The timestamp is also part of the signature. The timestamp must be formatted to [ISO 8061](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) specifications.

*Example*

    X-Timestamp: 2014-06-02T15:39:31.2729234Z

### Public resources

Public resources do not require a *signature* in the **Authorization** header. However, the client must send an HTTP *Authorization* header with the *ApplicationKey*. A client can also perform a signed request to the public resource.

    Authorization = “Application” + " " + ApplicationKey

### Protected resources

Protected resources require a **signed** request. The signature is used to validate the client and to check whether the client is authorized to perform the operation. The Api is using standard HTTP *Authorization* header to pass authorization information. The following schemes are supported:

  - **Application signed request** - Used to sign requests that are specific to a particular application. Most Sinch APIs require this type of authorization scheme.
  - **User signed request** - Used to create instances. It is mainly used to login with your email account in order to perform administrative tasks such as rented numbers administration.
  - **Instance signed request** - Used to sign requests that are relevant only to your account and not specific to an application, such as administering rented numbers.

#### Application signed request

Use the following syntax to sign a request for the Sinch Platform. The result should be included in the HTTP *Authorization* header sent with the HTTP Request.

    Authorization = Scheme + " " + applicationKey + “:” + Signature

    Scheme = “Application”

    Signature = Base64 ( HMAC-SHA256 ( applicationSecret, UTF8 (
    StringToSign ) ) );

    StringToSign = HTTP-Verb + “\n” +
    Content-MD5 + “\n” +
    Content-Type + “\n” +
    CanonicalizedHeaders + “\n” +
    CanonicalizedResource;

    Content-MD5 = Base64 ( MD5 ( UTF8 ( [BODY] ) ) )

*CanonicalizedHeaders*: Currently the only header required is “X-Timestamp”.

To get the *applicationKey* and *applicationSecret*, you should create an application in the Sinch dashboard. The dashboard will display your application key and secret pair that can be used to sign requests.

*Example*

    applicationKey: 5F5C418A0F914BBC8234A9BF5EDDAD97 applicationSecret:
    JViE5vDor0Sw3WllZka15Q==

> **Note**
>
> The application secret value must be decoded from Base64 before it is used for signing.

*Example of an application signed request to a protected resource*

For the following POST request to the protected resource /v1/sms/+46700000000,

    POST /v1/sms/+46700000000
    X-Timestamp: 2014-06-04T13:41:58Z
    Content-Type: application/json

    {“message”:“Hello world”}

the signature should be formed like this:

    Content-MD5 = Base64 ( MD5 ( UTF8 ( [BODY] ) ) )
        jANzQ+rgAHyf1MWQFSwvYw==

    StringToSign
    POST
    jANzQ+rgAHyf1MWQFSwvYw==
    application/json
    x-timestamp:2014-06-04T13:41:58Z
    /v1/sms/+46700000000

    Signature = Base64 ( HMAC-SHA256 ( Secret, UTF8 ( StringToSign ) ) )
        qDXMwzfaxCRS849c/2R0hg0nphgdHciTo7OdM6MsdnM=

    HTTP Authorization Header Authorization: Application
        5F5C418A0F914BBC8234A9BF5EDDAD97:qDXMwzfaxCRS849c/2R0hg0nphgdHciTo7OdM6MsdnM=

> **Note**
>
> For requests that don’t contain a body (like GET requests) or requests where the body is empty, the Content-MD5 value of StringToSign should be left empty.

    StringToSign = HTTP-Verb + “\n” +
        “\n” +
        Content-Type + “\n” +
        CanonicalizedHeaders + “\n” +
        CanonicalizedResource;

**CanonicalizedHeaders**: Currently the only header required is “X-Timestamp”.  

##### User signed request


    Authorization = “User” + " " + USER_AUTHORIZATION

> **Note**
>
> The USER\_AUTHORIZATION is received in its entiry from ‘\[POST\] /authentication’. It can be added to the header as it is.

*Example*

    Authorization: User eyJhcHBsaWNhdGlvbktleSI6IllPVVJfQVBQTElDQVRJT05fS0VZIiwiaWRlbnRpdHkiOnsidHlwZSI6ImVtYWlsIiwiZW5kcG9pbnQiOiJhZGRyZXNzQGV4YW1wbGUuY29tIn0sImNyZWF0ZWQiOiIyMDE1LTA2LTI0VDA4OjMyOjMyLjk0MTc2MDVaIn0=:Uc3UQ6tnextCCXiuieizBGNf16SDKFGFWMpu6LKbOwA=

#### Instance signed request

In order to increase security and minimize the risk of app secrets to be compromised requests can be signed. The signature is used to validate that the client and check if the client is authorized to perform the operation. Security is increased since the secret is not actually part on the message sent over the wire.

    Authorization = “Instance” + " " + INSTANCE_ID + “:” + INSTANCE_SIGNATURE

    INSTANCE_SIGNATURE = Base64 ( Hmac-Sha256 ( INSTANCE_SECRET, Utf8 (STRING_TO_SIGN ) ) )

    STRING_TO_SIGN = HTTP-Verb + “\n” +
        CONTENT_MD5 + “\n” +
        Content-Type + “\n” +
        CanonicalizedHeaders + “\n” +
        CanonicalizedResource;

    CONTENT_MD5 = Base64 ( Md5 ( [BODY] ) )

*INSTANCE\_SECRET*: INSTANCE\_SECRET is received from ‘\[POST\] /instances’ as a Base64 encoded byte array. It **must** be decoded from Base64 before being used for signing.

*CanonicalizedHeaders* - Currently the only header required is “X-Timestamp”.

#### Callback request signing

The Sinch Platform can initiate callback requests to a URL you define on events like call initiation, call answer, and call disconnect. All callback requests are signed using your Application key and Secret pair. The signature is included in the Authorization header of the
   request.

    Authorization = “Application” + " " + PartnerApplicationKey + “:” + Signature

    Signature = Base64 ( HMAC-SHA256 ( PartnerApplicationSecret, UTF8 (StringToSign ) ) );

    StringToSign = HTTP-Verb + “\n” +
        Content-MD5 + “\n” +
        Content-Type + “\n” +
        CanonicalizedHeaders + “\n” +
        CanonicalizedResource;

    Content-MD5 = Base64 ( MD5 ( [BODY] ) )

*Example*

    PartnerApplicationKey = 669E367E-6BBA-48AB-AF15-266871C28135
    PartnerApplicationSecret = BeIukql3pTKJ8RGL5zo0DA==

    HTTP Authorization Header
        Authorization: Application 669E367E-6BBA-48AB-AF15-266871C28135:Tg6fMyo8mj9pYfWQ9ssbx3Tc1BNC87IEygAfLbJqZb4=



#### Callback request validation

Your development platform that receives the callbacks can verify that the request originated from Sinch by re-signing the request and comparing the result with the value contained in the *Application* HTTP header.

#### Basic authorization


To get started quickly, applications are enabled to use basic authorization instead of signing messages. To use basic authorization, set the application key as the username and the secret from the portal as the password.

    //application call
    usernameAndPassword = “application" + ApplicationKey + ”:" + ApplicationSecret

To get the *applicationKey* and *applicationSecret*, you should create an application in the Sinch dashboard. The dashboard will display your application key and secret pair that can be used to sign requests.

By convention, the username and password need to be base64 encoded before being added to the header:

    Authorization = “basic” + " " + Base64 ( usernameAndPassword )

## Methods

The API is developed using the following REST style operations:

    [GET] - Fetch / Query
    [POST] - Create / New / Start
    [PUT] - 'Full' Update / Alter / Modify
    [PATCH] - 'Partially' Update / Alter / Modify
    [DELETE] - Remove / Stop / Cancel

### Errors

The API uses the HTTP status code to indicate failure and the body contains more information.

    [Error]
        int - errorCode
        string - message

*Example*

    HTTP Status Code: 401 (Unauthorized)
    {
        "errorCode":40102,
        "message":"Invalid Signature"
    }

### Error Codes

An error code contains five digits. The first three digits are the same as the HTTP Status Code.

    [BadRequest - 400]
    40001 - Parameter Validation

    [Unauthorized - 401]
    40100 - Authorization Header
    40101 - Timestamp Header
    40102 - Invalid Signature

    [InternalServerError - 500]
    50000 - Internal Server Error

    [ServiceUnavailable - 503]
    50300 - Temporary Down

## Types

There are standard types, array types, and custom types.

### Standard Types

    string - string
    int - signed 32 bit number
