## Manage Call

**\[Patch\] /calls/id/{callId}**

Plays messages in an ongoing call and optionally hangs up the call.

### Request
```json
[RequestBody]
    SVAML

[SVAML]
    Instruction[] - instructions
    Action - action
```


This method can be used to play messages in an ongoing call and potentially perform an action, such as hanging up the call. There are two instructions available to play a message. The *PlayFiles* instruction can be used to play an IVR message, while the *Say* instruction can be used to play a text-to-speech message. The message, if specified, is played only on the caller side. A caller can, for example, hear a message saying the total minutes have expired and that the call will be disconnected.

> **WARNING: Important**    
>
> This method can only be used for calls that are originating from or terminating to the PSTN network.

For more information on playing messages and performing actions on calls see the `Callback API <callbackapi>`.

## Conference and Text-To-Speech Callouts<span id="callouts"></span>

**\[POST\] /callouts**

Requests a call to be initiated from the server

### Request
```text
[RequestBody]
    CalloutRequest

[CalloutRequest]
    string - method
    TtsCalloutRequest? - ttsCallout
    ConferenceCalloutRequest? - conferenceCallout
```


There are currently two types of callouts that are supported: conference callouts and text-to-speech callouts.

### Conference callout

With conference callout, the server initiates call to a phone number and when the call is answered, it is connected to a conference room. The same API can be used multiple times to connect multiple phone numbers in the same conference room.

### Request
```json
[ConferenceCalloutRequest]
    string - cli
    Identity - destination
    int - maxDuration
    bool - enableAce
    bool - enableDice
    bool - enablePie
    string - custom
    string - locale
    string - conferenceId
    string - greeting
    string - mohClass
```


**cli** is the number that will be displayed as caller

**destination** identifies the endpoint that should be called.

**type** can be “number” for PSTN endpoints, or “username” for data endpoints (app or web clients).

**endpoint** is either the number of a PSTN endpoint, or the username for a data endpoint.

**domain** can be either “pstn” for PSTN endpoint or “mxp” for data (app or web) clients.

**custom** can be used to input custom data.

**locale** specifies the language for the Text-to-speech message. Supported languages: \* en-US: English, United States \* en-AU: English, Australia \* en-CA: English, Canada \* en-GB: English, United Kingdom \* en-IN: English, India \* es-ES: Spanish, Spain \* es-MX: Spanish, Mexico \* es-CA : Spanish, Catalunya \* fr-FR: French, France \* fr-CA: French, Canada \* ja-JP: Japanese \* ko-KR: Korean \* pt-BR: Portuguese, Brazil \* pt-PT: Portuguese \* zn-CN: Chinese, China \* zh-HK: Chinese, Hong
Kong \* zh-TW: Chinese, Taiwan \* da-DK: Danish \* de-DE: German \* fi-FI: Finish \* it-IT: Italian \* nb-NO: Norwegian \* nl-NL: Dutch \* pl-PL: Polish \* ru-RU: Russian \* sv-SE: Swedish

**greeting** is the text that will be spoken as a greeting.

**conferenceId** shows the Id of the conference to which the participant will be connected.

If **enableAce** is set to true and the application has a callback URL specified, you will receive an ACE callback when the call is answered. When the callback is received, your platform must respond with a svamlet, containing the “connectconf” action in order to add the call to a conference or create the conference if it’s the first call. If it is set to false, no ACE event will be sent to your backend.

*Example ACE response when* `enableAce` *set to true*
```json
{
  "instructions": [],
    "action": {
      "name": "connectConf",
        "conferenceId": "myConference"
    }
}
```


If **enableDice** is set to true and the application has a callback URL specified, you will receive a DiCE callback when the call is disconnected. If it is set to false, no DiCE event will be sent to your backend.

If **enablePie** is set to true and the application has a callback URL specified, you will receive a PIE callback after a runMenu action, with the information of the action that the user took. If it is set to false, no PIE event will be sent to your backend.

*Example of conference callout*
```text
[POST] https://callingapi.sinch.com/v1/callouts
```



```json
{
  "method" : "conferenceCallout",
    "conferenceCallout" :
    {
      "cli" : "46000000000",
        "destination" : { "type" : "number", "endpoint" : "46000000001" },
          "domain" : "pstn",
            "custom" : "customData",
              "locale" : "en-US",
                "greeting" : "Welcome to my conference",
                  "conferenceId" : "my_conference_room_id",
                    "enableAce": false,
                      "enableDice" : false
    }
}
```


### Text-to-speech

With the text-to-speech callout, the server initiates a call to a phone number and plays a synthesized text messages or pre-recorded sound files.

### Authorization

This is a protected resource and requires an `application signed request <applicationsignedrequest>` or `basic auth <basicauthorization>`.

### Request
```json
[TtsCalloutRequest]
    string - cli
    Identity - destination
    string - domain
    string - custom
    string - locale
    string - text
    string - prompts
    bool - enableAce
    bool - enableDice
```


**cli** is the number that will be displayed as caller

**destination** identifies the endpoint that should be called.

**type** is a parameter inside the “destination” object. It can be “number” for PSTN endpoints, or “username” for data endpoints (app or web clients).

**endpoint** is a parameter inside the “destination” object. It is either the number of a PSTN endpoint, or the username for a data endpoint.

**domain** can be either “pstn” for PSTN endpoint or “mxp” for data (app or web) clients.

**custom** can be used to input custom data.

If **enableAce** is set to true and the application has a callback URL specified, you will receive an ACE callback when the call is answered. When the callback is received, your platform must respond with a svamlet, typically containing a “playFiles” instruction and a “hangup” action. If it is set to false, no ACE event will be sent to your backend.

*Example ACE response when \`\`enableAce\`\` set to true*
```json
{
  "instructions": [
    {
      "name": "playFiles",
      "ids": [
        "#tts[hello world]"
      ]
    }
  ],
    "action": {
      "name": "hangup"
    }
}
```


*Example ACE response when \`\`enableAce\`\` set to true*. In this example, the result will be the same as it would with the enableAce set to false - the message specified in the `TtsCalloutRequest` will be played
```json
{
  "instructions": [],
    "action": {
      "name": "continue"
    }
}
```


If **enableDice** is set to true and the application has a callback URL specified, you will receive a DiCE callback when the call is disconnected. If it is set to false, no DiCE event will be sent to your backend.

**locale** specifies the language for the Text-to-speech message. Supported languages: \* en-US: English, United States \* en-AU: English, Australia \* en-CA: English, Canada \* en-GB: English, United Kingdom \* en-IN: English, India \* es-ES: Spanish, Spain \* es-MX: Spanish, Mexico \* es-CA : Spanish, Catalunya \* fr-FR: French, France \* fr-CA: French, Canada \* ja-JP: Japanese \* ko-KR: Korean \* pt-BR: Portuguese, Brazil \* pt-PT: Portuguese \* zn-CN: Chinese, China \* zh-HK: Chinese, Hong Kong \* zh-TW: Chinese, Taiwan \* da-DK: Danish \* de-DE: German \* fi-FI: Finish \* it-IT: Italian \* nb-NO: Norwegian \* nl-NL: Dutch \* pl-PL: Polish \* ru-RU: Russian \* sv-SE: Swedish

**text** is the text that will be spoken in the text-to-speech message.

**prompts** is an advanced alternative to to using “text”. You can then supply a “;”-separated list of prompts. Either prompt can be the name of a pre-recorded file or a text-to-speech string specified as “\#tts\[my text\]”. To upload and use pre-recorded files, you need to contact Sinch for support.
