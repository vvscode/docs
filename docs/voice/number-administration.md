This document outlines how to administrate numbers through the same endpoints used by the Sinch dashboard. It has two logical steps:

  - Starting a session:
      - Logging in
      - Creating an instance
      - Retrieving your account’s organisation data
  - Working with the “number” endpoints.
      - Listing available numbers
      - Reserving a quantity of numbers
      - Checking out the reservation
      - Listing numbers on the account or attached to an application
      - Assigning to an application
      - Unassigning from an application

For general information on how to use the Sinch APIs including methods, types, errors and authorization, please check the [Using REST](doc:using-rest) page.

---

## Log in

First you need to login to retrieve a token that will be used to create an instance.

### Headers

This is a [public resource](doc:using-rest#section-public-resources).

When logging in, you should always pass in the header the “number administration” key. This is the key that you should pass:

    669762D5-2B10-44E0-8418-BC9EE4457555

> **Note**
>
> Always use this exact key in the log in step. Do not use any of your app keys.

    Authorization: Application 669762D5-2B10-44E0-8418-BC9EE4457555
    X-Timestamp: {now}

    eg:
    Authorization: Application 669762D5-2B10-44E0-8418-BC9EE4457555
    X-Timestamp: 2015-06-20T11:43:10.944Z

### Request

    [POST]

    URL:
    https://userapi.sinch.com/v1/users/{type}/{identity}/authentication

    eg:
    https://userapi.sinch.com/v1/users/email/address@example.com/authentication

    [body]
        string - password

    eg:
```json
{
    "password":"YOUR_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD"
}
```

### Response

    string - authorization
    User   - user

    eg:
```json
{
   "authorization":"eyJhcHBsaWNhdGlvbktleSI6IllPVVJfQVBQTElDQVRJT05fS0VZIiwiaWRlbnRpdHkiOnsidHlwZSI6ImVtYWlsIiwiZW5kcG9pbnQiOiJhZGRyZXNzQGV4YW1wbGUuY29tIn0sImNyZWF0ZWQiOiIyMDE1LTA2LTI0VDA4OjMyOjMyLjk0MTc2MDVaIn0=:Uc3UQ6tnextCCXiuieizBGNf16SDKFGFWMpu6LKbOwA=",
   "user":{
      "id":123456789,
      "identities":[
         {
            "type":"email",
            "endpoint":"address@example.com"
         },
         {
            "type":"number",
            "endpoint":"+12055500000"
         }
      ],
      "profile":{
         "name":{
            "first":"Jane",
            "last":"Bloggs",
            "full":"Jane Bloggs"
         },
         "contact":{
            "email":"address@example.com"
         }
      }
   }
}
```

---

## Create an instance

As a second step, you need to create an instance with the ‘authorization’ string received from the authentication response (above).

### Headers

This is a protected resource and requires a [user signed request](doc:using-rest#section-user-signed-request).

    Authorization: User {authorization}
    X-Timestamp: {now}

    eg:
    Authorization: User eyJhcHBsaWNhdGlvbktleSI6IllPVVJfQVBQTElDQVRJT05fS0VZIiwiaWRlbnRpdHkiOnsidHlwZSI6ImVtYWlsIiwiZW5kcG9pbnQiOiJhZGRyZXNzQGV4YW1wbGUuY29tIn0sImNyZWF0ZWQiOiIyMDE1LTA2LTI0VDA4OjMyOjMyLjk0MTc2MDVaIn0=:Uc3UQ6tnextCCXiuieizBGNf16SDKFGFWMpu6LKbOwA=
    X-Timestamp: 2015-06-20T11:43:10.944Z

### Request

    [POST]

    URL:
    https://api.sinch.com/v1/instance


[body]
    string   - authorization
    Version  - version

[Version]
    string - os
    string - platform

eg:
```json
{
   "authorization":"eyJhcHBsaWNhdGlvbktleSI6IllPVVJfQVBQTElDQVRJT05fS0VZIiwiaWRlbnRpdHkiOnsidHlwZSI6ImVtYWlsIiwiZW5kcG9pbnQiOiJhZGRyZXNzQGV4YW1wbGUuY29tIn0sImNyZWF0ZWQiOiIyMDE1LTA2LTI0VDA4OjMyOjMyLjk0MTc2MDVaIn0=:Uc3UQ6tnextCCXiuieizBGNf16SDKFGFWMpu6LKbOwA=",
   "version":{
      "os":"{os}",
      "platform":"{platform}"
   }
}  
```

> **Note**
>
> ‘version’ data is mandatory, but is up to the client to decide how to populate it. Choose values that best represent your OS and platform combination.

### Response

    [Instance]
        string   - id
        byte[]   - secret
        integer? - expiresIn

    eg:

```json
{
   "id":"00a3ffb1-0808-4dd4-9c7d-e4383d82e445",
   "secret":"bRo76GRddEyetgJDTgkLHA==",
   "expiresIn":172800
}
```

## Get organization

With the instance that you created you can now perform instance signed requests, which are needed for the number administration endpoints. First you should retrieve your organisation Id.

    X-Timestamp: 2015-06-20T11:43:10.944Z

### Request

    [GET]

    URL:
    https://api.sinch.com/v1/organisations

    [body]
        empty

    eg:

### Response

    [Organisation]
        int - id
        string? - name
        string? - website
        string? - countryId
        string? - phone
        string? - vatnumber

eg:

```json
  {
     "id":"8888123",
     "name":"Acme"
     "website":"http://www.example.com"
     "phone":"+12055500000"

## Add numbers to an application (Overwrite)

This API overwrites all numbers assigned to your app with the new set of numbers that you specify.

> **Attention**
>
> When using this API method, any numbers that may already be configured for the particular application will be overwritten by the new list of numbers that you specify in this API call.

A new endpoint to only add a specific number to an application without overwriting the existing numbers will be available very soon.
