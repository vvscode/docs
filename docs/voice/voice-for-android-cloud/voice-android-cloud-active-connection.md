If push notifications are not desired, the alternative is to use `setSupportActiveConnectionInBackground(true)` and then calling `startListeningOnActiveConnection()` to enable incoming calls. Don’t forget to call `stopListeningOnActiveConnection()` when the user is no longer available for calls (for example if the application is no longer active).

> **Important**
>
> Listening on the active connection in a background service is not guaranteed started from Android 9. Android OS can stop background services at any moment. Use [managed push functionality]() to receive incoming calls from the background or when the application is stopped (but not _force stopped_).
