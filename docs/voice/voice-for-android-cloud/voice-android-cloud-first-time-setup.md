## Register an Application

1.  Register a Sinch Developer account [here](https://portal.sinch.com/#/signup).
2.  Setup a new Application using the Dashboard where you can then obtain an _Application Key_ and an _Application Secret_.

## Download - We are now in Closed Beta Phase!

The Sinch Closed BETA SDKs can only be obtained after direct contact with Sinch Voice & Video Team.  
Contact [Sinch support](mailto:support@sinch.com). Please add the phrase "CLOSED BETA REQUEST" on your email subject.

<!-- ## Download

The Sinch SDK can be downloaded [here](https://sinch.readme.io/page/downloads). It contains: the library _aar_, this user guide, reference documentation, and sample apps for calling. -->

## Add the Sinch library

The Sinch SDK library is distributed in [AAR](http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system/aar-format) format. To use it in your project either:

> - Copy the **.aar** file to the `libs` folder and edit the build.gradle file to include

```text
repositories {
    flatDir {
        dirs 'libs'
    }
}

dependencies {
    implementation(name:'sinch-android-rtc', version:'+', ext:'aar')
}
```

> - Or using Android Studio choose `File -> New -> New Module -> Import .JAR/.AAR Package` option

## Running ProGuard

If you are using ProGuard, we bundle an example proguard-project.txt file that makes sure that the Sinch SDK will work as expected.

## Permissions

A minimum set of permissions are needed for the app to use the Sinch SDK. These are specified in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file. If the calling functionality will be used, all five permissions listed here are needed. However, if the calling functionality isn’t used, the last three (RECORD_AUDIO, MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS and READ_PHONE_STATE) can be omitted.

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE" />
```

> **Note**
>
> By default, the Sinch SDK hangs up any Sinch call if the regular phone app has an active call. This functionality requires the permission READ_PHONE_STATE. However, if this default functionality isn’t wanted, turn it off by calling `sinchClient.getCallClient().setRespectNativeCalls(false);` and the permission READ_PHONE_STATE is not needed.

### Verify manifest in runtime during development

To verify that the manifest has the necessary permissions the `sinchClient.checkManifest()` method can be used. This method should be called before starting the client and will throw an `MissingPermissionException` exception if the manifest isn’t setup correctly. `sinchClient.checkManifest()` should only be called during development. When the application is ready for release the method call can safely be removed.

_Note:_ This method takes into consideration which features the app supports (for example, calling, respecting native calls, and so on). Call `sinchClient.checkManifest()` after the setup but before the start of the SinchClient.
