## Register an Application

> 1.  Register a Sinch Developer account [here](https://portal.sinch.com/#/signup).
> 2.  Setup a new Application using the Dashboard where you can then obtain an _Application Key_ and an _Application Secret_.

## Download - We are now in Closed Beta Phase!

The Sinch Closed BETA SDKs can only be obtained after direct contact with Sinch Voice & Video Team.  
Contact [Sinch support](mailto:support@sinch.com). Please add the phrase _"CLOSED BETA REQUEST"_ on your email subject.

### Sinch SDK as a CocoaPod

> **Note**
>
> CocoaPods version will be available only for Production releases (i.e. not closed beta releases)

## Add the _Sinch.framework_

Drag the _Sinch.framework_ bundle from the SDK distribution package folder into the Frameworks section in the Xcode Project Navigator.

The Sinch SDK depends on the following frameworks which must be linked with the application target:

> _libc++.dylib_ (_libc++.tbd_), _libz.tbd_, _Security.framework_, _AVFoundation.framework_, _AudioToolbox.framework_, _VideoToolbox.framework_, _CoreMedia.framework_, _CoreVideo.framework_, _CoreImage.framework_, _GLKit.framework_, _OpenGLES.framework_, _QuartzCore.framework_, _Metal.framework_

## Info.plist

If voice calling functionality will be enabled and used, add the following to your _Info.plist_:

- Required background modes (`UIBackgroundModes`):

  - Application plays audio (`audio`)
  - Application provides Voice over IP services (`voip`)

- Privacy - Microphone Usage Description (`NSMicrophoneUsageDescription`):

  [NSMicrophoneUsageDescription](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/content/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CocoaKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009251-SW25) describes the reason your app accesses the microphone. When the system prompts the user to allow access, this string is displayed as part of the alert, and it _cannot_ be left empty.

In addition to the keys above, if video calling functionality will be enabled and used, add the following to your _Info.plist_:

- Privacy - Camera Usage Description
  (`NSCameraUsageDescription`):

  [NSCameraUsageDescription](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/content/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CocoaKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009251-SW24) describes the reason that your app accesses the camera. When the system prompts the user to allow access, this string is displayed as part of the alert, and it _cannot_ be left empty.
