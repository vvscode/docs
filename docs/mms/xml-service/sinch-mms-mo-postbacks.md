The MMS MO postback API notifies you that a customer has replied to your message, or interacted to one of your keywords.

## MMS MO Information
To receive MMS MO postback you need to work with your Sinch Account Manager to provision with your account. Once the MMS MO postback is enabled you will start receiving postbacks for each MMS MO received on the MMS MO Keyword or Short Code.

## The MMS MO
