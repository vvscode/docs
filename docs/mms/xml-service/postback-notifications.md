title: "Postback Notifications"

When an MMS is saved, the system will generate a Postback notification and unlock MMS for further use. If an MMS contain audio/video, Postback will be sent when the encoding of the MMS audio/video is finished, otherwise Postback notification will be sent instantly. Below is an example of Postback notification when an MMS is saved successfully:

**saveMMS Postback notification**
```xml
<POSTBACK>
    <ORIGIN>MMS_MT</ORIGIN>
    <CODE>N003</CODE>
    <MMSID>35674</MMSID>
</POSTBACK>
```


If there was an error encoding the MMS audio/video, the system will generate a notification:

**saveMMS error Postback Notification**
```xml
<POSTBACK>
    <ORIGIN>MMS_MT</ORIGIN>
    <CODE>E002</CODE>
    <MMSID>35674</MMSID>
    <AUDIONAME>http://www.yoursite.com/audio/1.mp3</AUDIONAME>
</POSTBACK>
```


## Special Considerations for saveMMS

  - The API SHALL reformat the content when necessary so that it can be delivered to the end users handset in the best possible way.
  - Delivery success takes precedence over audio and video content quality and occasionally the picture quality will be reduced to fit handset message size requirements.
  - Video SHALL be reduced in quality to fit delivery limitations and if it still does not fit it will be delivered as XHTML/SMS.
  - Each request MUST contain at least one slide which MAY contain text and/or image and/or video and/or audio and/or objects (vcard/ical/pdf/passbook).
  - The API SHALL support up to 80 characters in the MMS subject.
  - The API SHALL support up to 8 slides for each MMS submission.
  - The API SHALL NOT support multiple files of the same MIME type on the same slide.
  - Slides with image SHALL NOT support video but SHALL support audio.
  - Slides with audio SHALL NOT support video. Slides with video SHALL only support text.
  - Slides with text SHALL support up to 5000 characters in any slide.
  - Slide with vcard/ical/pdf/passbook object SHALL NOT support media type audio/video/image and vice-versa.
  - All slides MAY contain a duration for playback.
  - Default slide duration is 10 seconds.
  - Slide duration will be overwritten with the audio/video file duration after encoding is completed.
  - URLs provided MUST contain the full path to the mime files.
  - Slide Duration SHOULD NOT exceed 30 seconds.
  - MMS subject is required.
  - MMS containing audio/video can be used only when audio/video encoding is completed.
  - After submission you will not be given a successful acknowledgement of audio/video encoding when a message is submitted
  - The HTTP status of audio/video encoding after it has been completed will be sent to your Postback URL.
  - Supported Media: TEXT/PLAIN, GIF/JPG/PNG, MP3/WAV, 3GP, MP4, MPEG, MPG, AVI, WMV.
  - There is a maximum source file size for each supported source file submitted.
  - You can find out what the current maximum is by visiting your API settings.
  - MMS messages are delivered in B64 encoding To estimate the final size of Base64-encoded binary data multiply the filesize by 1.37 times the original data size + 814 bytes (for headers).
