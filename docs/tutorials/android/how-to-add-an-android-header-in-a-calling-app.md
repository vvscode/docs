The app is built on top of the **sinch-rtc-sample-calling** sample included in the Android SDK, and the finished code can be found on [our GitHub](https://www.github.com/sinch/android-app-app-calling-headers).

## Setup

1.  Create a free [Sinch developer account](https://portal.sinch.com/#/signup)
2.  Create an app in the [Developer Dashboard](https://portal.sinch.com/#/apps)
3.  Download the `Sinch Android SDK <sinchvvvdownloads>`
4.  Add your app key and secret to the **sinch-rtc-sample-calling** app included in the SDK (in **SinchService.java**)

## Update SinchServiceInterface

Sinch allows you to make an app-to-app call and send along a `Map<String, String>` of headers. First, extend the `SinchServiceInterface` in **SinchService.java** to support this method:

```java
public Call callUser(String userId, Map<String, String> headers) {
    return mSinchClient.getCallClient().callUser(userId, headers);
}
```

## Get location and make the call

You’ll need the following permission to access the device’s location:

```java
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
```

Now, in `callButtonClicked` in **PlaceCallActivity.java**, you can get the latitude and longitude of the last known location:

```java
LocationManager locationManager = (LocationManager) getSystemService(Context.LOCATION_SERVICE);
Location lastLoc = locationManager.getLastKnownLocation(LocationManager.NETWORK_PROVIDER);
Double longitude = lastLoc.getLongitude();
Double latitude = lastLoc.getLatitude();
```

> **Note**
>
> This is definitely not a production-ready way of getting an accurate location. First of all, your app will crash if the user doesn’t have any “last location.” You could also use the ACCESS\_COARSE\_LOCATION permission, since you don’t need to know their *exact* location. Regardless, there are several location strategies and I suggest doing some research if you want to send a current location in your production app.

Use a Geocoder object to turn the latitude and and longitude into a human-readable address:

```java
Geocoder geocoder = new Geocoder(this, Locale.getDefault());
List<Address> addresses = null;
try {
    addresses = geocoder.getFromLocation(latitude, longitude, 1);
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

I chose to send the city/state/zipcode of the location as the header:

```java
Map<String, String> headers = new HashMap<String, String>();
headers.put("location", addresses.get(0).getAddressLine(0));
```

You can add as many items as you like to the headers like so:

```java
headers.put("key", "value");
```

Finally, change this line that makes the call:

```java
Call call = getSinchServiceInterface().callUser(userName);
```

to this:

```java
Call call = getSinchServiceInterface().callUser(userName, headers);
```

## Display header value on incoming call

In `SinchCallClientListener#onIncomingCall` in **SinchService.java**, get the location value from the headers, and pass it along in the intent:

```java
intent.putExtra("location", call.getHeaders().get("location"));
```

Then, in **IncomingCallScreenActivity.java**, you can get the location from the intent like so:

```java
String location = getIntent().getStringExtra(SinchService.LOCATION);
```

I chose to create a TextView with ID remoteUserLocation in **incoming.xml**, so I could set it to the location from the header in `onServiceConnected` (right where the remoteUserId TextView is set).

```java
TextView remoteUserLocation = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.remoteUserLocation);
remoteUserLocation.setText("Calling from " + mCallLocation);
```

That’s all\! Rinse and repeat for any data you want to send along with an app-to-app call.
