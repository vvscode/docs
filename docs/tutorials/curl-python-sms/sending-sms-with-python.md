from sinchsms import SinchSMS

number = '+yourmobilenumber'
message = 'I love SMS!'

client = SinchSMS(your_app_key, your_app_secret)

print("Sending '%s' to %s" % (message, number))
response = client.send_message(number, message)
message_id = response['messageId']

response = client.check_status(message_id)
while response['status'] != 'Successful':
    print(response['status'])
    time.sleep(1)
    response = client.check_status(message_id)
    print(response['status'])
```

If you don’t want to use a module, you can find the source code for the module on GitHub: <https://github.com/sinch/python-sinch-sms>
