In this tutorial we are going to create a very simple conference calling app where you can call in to a number and be connected to anyone. A little bit like the carrier hotlines back in the day (maybe they still exist, any one know?).

This tutorial will take approx. 15 min to finish.

## Setup

To get started, you will need:

 1.  A [Sinch account](https://portal.sinch.com/#/signup) and an app with keys
 1.  A phone number [rented from Sinch](https://portal.sinch.com/dashboard/#/numbers); make sure it’s a voice number
 1.  A place to host your backend, I am hosting my app on Azure for free

## Rent a number

Go to your dashboard, and click on numbers. Then click on the “Rent Numbers” button.

Then, pick a local number you will be calling in to.

After your rented a number you need to configure your app. If you dont have one, just create a new one.

For this tutorial the endpoint for callbacks will be `http://yourserver/sinch` so make sure you have a place to host and configure your callback to that address.

So now I have an app that as soon as someone dials **+14153493281** will make a callback to my URL. Because I have nothing there right now, the call will just hangup.

## Create a node app

As I mentioned before, this is going to be a super simple implementation where everyone will be connected to the conference, no questions asked.

Let’s start creating a node app. Open a powershell or terminal and create a folder to host your app.

```powershell
npm init
npm install express -save
npm install body-parser -save
```

This creates a **packages.json** file and installs a [express dependency](http://expressjs.com/). The reason for using express apart from it being popular, is it has some nice json extensions and I like MVC frameworks as an organisation for web apps. Open up your favorite text editor. I am using Visual Studio Code which is an awesome tool with a good debug feature and really nice intellisense. Open up **packages.json** and change **main** to **app.js**.

**packages.json**

```json
{
  "name": "nodecallbacks",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "app.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.13.3"
  }
}
```

Next create a file called **app.js** in the root folder, and start coding:

**app.js**

```javascript
// add requires
var express = require('express');
var bodyParser = require('body-parser');
var router = require('./routes/sinch');

//set up an app
var app = express();
//configure on what port express will create your app
var port = process.env.PORT || 5000;

//congigure body parsing for the app,
//in this tutorial we will be doing json only
app.use(bodyParser.json());

//add the sinch route
app.use('/sinch', router);

//add default content type for all requests
app.use(function (req, res, next) {
  res.setHeader("Content-Type","application/json");
  next();
});
//export and start listening
module.exports = app;
app.listen(port);
```

Nothing strange here, just some basic express setup of an app. Note that now we don’t respond to anything…yet. Create a folder and call it **routes** and add a file called **sinch.js** to it. This will be our route to handle posts from the sinch backend.

**sinch.js**

```javascript
// add requires
var express = require('express');
var router = express.Router();
router.post('/', function (req, res, next) {
    //echo the post
    res.json(req.body);
}
);
module.exports = router;
```

The only thing this router does at the moment is to echo whatever you post in to Sinch. Try it out and make sure it works. I am using Postman to create my day to day testing.

## Add Sinch funcationality.

As mentioned before, as soon as someone calls in on a the phone number, Sinch will make a callback to my backend and I can respond with what we call **SVAML**. More information about our REST API’s can be found [here](doc:voice-rest-api) and for this tutorial we are particularly interested in the [ICE event](doc:voice-rest-api-callback-api).

Whenever someone calls in, I want to connect them to my conference with their caller ID. So reading the docs, I see that to connect to a conference (which is in fact exactly what a hotline is), I just need to respond with this:

**Conference Response**

```json
{
    "Action":
    {
        "name" : "ConnectConf",
        "conferenceId" : "myConference123"
    }
}
```

But I also wanted to spice it up and welcome the caller with a text to speech command in the instructions parameters.

**Welcome Message**

```json
{
    "name" : "Say",
    "text" : "Hello, this is a text to speech message",
    "locale" : "en-US"
}
```

In **sinch.js** just below `var router` add the SVAML code.

**SVAML Response**

```javascript
var svamlResponse =
    {
        instructions: [
            {
                "name": "Say",
                "text": "Welcome to the hotline",
                "locale": "en-US"
            }
        ],
        action: {
            "name": "ConnectConf",
            "conferenceId": "myconference1",
            "cli": "",
            "suppressCallbacks": true
        }
    }
```

You might notice that I added **supressCallbacks**, and this is because in this case I don’t want any more callbacks after the ICE event. So to connect to the conference, we need to change the the **router.post** to this

**router.post**

```javascript
router.post('/', function (req, res, next) {
    //we know its a ICE event since we supress callbacks for other events
    // set the callerid to the calling number
    svamlResponse.action.cli = req.body.cli;
    //send back the response.
    res.json(svamlResponse);
});
```

Fire it up localy and try and send this fake incoming body to your controller in Postman.

**Fake Request**

```json
{
   "event":"ice",
   "callid":"2DOQGZ3D2JA5JB54BI4OTPFT3I@81.201.84.195",
   "timestamp":"2015-11-11T03:28:25Z",
   "version":1,
   "userRate":{
      "currencyId":"USD",
      "amount":0.0
   },
   "cli":"15612600684",
   "to":{
      "type":"did",
      "endpoint":"+17864088196",
      "verified":null
   },
   "domain":"pstn",
   "applicationKey":"1680b6f8-aa0e-422f-bf25-932adb3a48af",
   "originationType":"PSTN"
}
```

And if everything works you should get back a response like this:

**Response**

```json
{
  "instructions": [
    {
      "name": "Say",
      "text": "Welcome to the hotline",
      "locale": "en-US"
    }
  ],
  "action": {
    "name": "ConnectConf",
    "conferenceId": "myconference1",
    "cli": "15612600684",
    "suppressCallbacks": true
  }
}
```

In order to test this out, deploy it your server that Sinch can access and make a test request to make sure you still get the correct SVAML response. Then dial in\!
