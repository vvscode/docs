Node module to send SMS world-wide from within a Node or web application (using Browserify).

Additional information available [on our website](https://www.sinch.com/products/messaging/sms/).

## Installing

Install is straight forward using npm;

```shell
npm install sinch-sms --save
```

> **Note**
>
> Module is compatible with browserify

## Include in your project

```javascript
    var sinchSms = require('sinch-sms')({
            key: 'YOUR APPLICATION_KEY',
            secret: 'YOUR_APPLICATION_SECRET'
        });
```

To send an SMS, simply call the `send()` method, as in this simple example:

```javascript
    var sinchSms = require('sinch-sms')({
            key: 'YOUR_APPLICATION_KEY',
            secret: 'YOUR_APPLICATION_SECRET'
        });

    sinchSms.send('+1555123456', 'Hello World!').then(function(response) {
        //All good, response contains messageId
        console.log(response);
    }).fail(function(error) {
        // Some type of error, see error object
        console.log(error);
    });
```

For a more complete sample, including how to poll delivery status for a given messageId, please see the provided samples.

## Methods

 - **send**(number, message) - Send SMS `message` to `number`
 - **getStatus**(messageId) - Retrieve status for message `messageId`

*Above methods return promises, see sample for how to chain further action on success / fail.*

## Samples

See the `samples/` folder, for some basic usage examples. Samples work fine both in Node.js and in the browser by using browserify.

> **Note**
>
> If you’re using your clientapi application key, SMS can only be sent to numbers you have verified in the [Sinch dashboard](https://portal.sinch.com/#/login).

First edit the relevant sample to ensure it got your credentials or user information. Then you can run the sample in Node using:

    $ node samples/SAMPLE_NAME.js

If you’d like to run it in the browser, first [browserify](http://browserify.org) the sample into a browser-compatible script using:

    $ browserify samples/SAMPLE_NAME.js > sample_bundle.js

Include the bundle in a web project, by adding the following tag to your HTML file:

    <script src="sample_bundle.js"></script>

Be sure to check the developer console for console output.
