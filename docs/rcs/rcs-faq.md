## How do I know if my handset is RCS capable?

While in Android Messages, you can select the 3 dots in the upper right side of the messages (thread) screen, then select "Settings", then "Advanced" and "Enhanced Features". You can see if RCS is toggled on or off. 

If you do not see those options to enable enhanced features, then you do not have RCS capabilities.

## How do I enable RCS for Android Messages?
The instructions below will prepare your device for RCS and to allow you to receive test messages from Sinch via the Google RCS Business Messaging service.

### Set up a Google account
If you don't already have one, set up a Google account that gives you access to access to Gmail (for more information [see this article](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441?hl=en)

### Add your Google account to the Android device
Follow the instructions in [this article](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2521798?hl=en-GB). Ensure the account set up before is the only Google account on the device.

### Install Android Messages from the Play Store
If you already have Android Messages installed on the handset, it is best if you uninstall and re-install it after the Google account has been added. This will ensure you have the most recent version of Messages for RCS for testing.

Android Messages can be [found on the Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.messaging)

### Ensure Google Carrier Services is up to date
An up-to-date version of Google Carrier Services should also be installed on the device. You can ensure you have the most recent version by going to the [app page on the Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.ims)

### Verify your connection
In this step you will verify your connection to the Google RCS Sandbox Servers:
