## Authentication
The Sinch WhatsApp API securely authenticates via a bot identifier and bearer token pair. During the initial client on boarding process, these will be provided by your account manager.

To be able to authenticate the access token needs to be passed. For all WhatsApp end-points it is required to set the [bearer token](https://oauth.net/2/bearer-tokens/) in the authorization HTTP header like: `Authorization: Bearer AbCdEf123456`. Where the string `AbCdEf123456` is the bearer authorization token.

If no authentication header is present or if the bearer token is invalid, the API will respond with HTTP 401 Unauthorized.

## BearerAuth

|                           |        |
| ------------------------- | ------ |
| Security scheme type      | HTTP   |
| HTTP Authorization Scheme | bearer |


## HTTP Errors
Responses with status `400 Bad Request` and `401 Unauthorized` will present a JSON object in the body explaining the error.
It has the following structure:

| Name      | Description                                                          | JSON Type |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| `message` | A error message describing the general error.                        | `String`  |
| `details` | Human readable description of the error. Can be used for debugging.  | `String`  |
