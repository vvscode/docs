## Authentication
The Sinch WhatsApp API securely authenticates via a bot identifier and bearer token pair. During the initial client on boarding process, these will be provided by your account manager.

To be able to authenticate the access token needs to be passed. For all WhatsApp end-points it is required to set the [bearer token](https://oauth.net/2/bearer-tokens/) in the authorization HTTP header like: `Authorization: Bearer AbCdEf123456`. Where the string `"AbCdEf123456"` is the bearer authorization token.

## BearerAuth

|                           |        |
| ------------------------- | ------ |
| Security scheme type      | HTTP   |
| HTTP Authorization Scheme | bearer |
