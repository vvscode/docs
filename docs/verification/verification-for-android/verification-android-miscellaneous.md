## ProGuard

If [ProGuard](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code.html) is used to shrink an artifact (e.g. an APK) that is consuming the Sinch Verification library, the *ProGuard* rules defined in the file `proguard-rules.pro`, which is included in the SDK package, must be applied.

## Encryption export regulations

Please check the Summary of U.S. Export Controls Applicable to Commercial Encryption Products and ensure that the application is registered for the Encryption Regulations, if applicable. It can be found under this [link](http://www.sinch.com/export).
