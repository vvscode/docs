```

The Sinch Verification API is used for verify mobile phone numbers. It is consumed by the Sinch Verification SDK, but it can also be used by any backend or client directly. yin

```text
    [POST] /verifications
    [PUT] /verifications/{type}/{endpoint}
```

The Sinch service uses three different verification methods:

1.  By sending an SMS message with a PIN code
2.  By placing a flashcall (missed call) and detecting the incoming calling number (CLI)
3.  By placing a PSTN call to the user's phone and playing an announcement, asking the user to press a particular digit to verify the phone number (only iOS)

## Verification Request

**\[POST\] /verifications/** - Start a verification

This method is used by the mobile and web Verification SDKs to start a verification. It can also be used to request a verification from your backend, by making an [Application signed request](doc:authorization#section-application-signed-request). It is a POST request which specifies the phone number that should be verified and the verification method.

### Authorization

Authorization level can be specified in the Sinch dashboard, under your app settings. By default it is set to "Deny". These schemes are allowed:

  - [Public authorization](doc:authorization#section-public-resources)
  - [Application signed request](doc:authorization#section-application-signed-request)
  - [Instance signed requests](doc:authorization#section-instance-signed-request)

### Request

    [RequestBody]
        VerificationRequest
    
    [VerificationRequest]
        identity - identity
        string - method
        string? - reference
        string? - custom
        object? - metadata
        FlashCallOptions? - flashCallOptions
    [FlashCallOptions]
        string? - cli
        int? - dialTimeout

**identity** indicates type of endpoint that will be verified and specifies the particular endpoint. The support endpoint type currently is only "number".

**method** indicates the verification method. Possible values are:

  - flashCall
  - sms
  - callout

**reference** can be used to pass your own reference in the request for tracking purposes.

**custom** can be used to pass custom data in the request.

**FlashCallOptions** is an optional object for flashCall verifications. It allows you to specify Cli and dial time out parameters for flashCall. Cli is a particular number to be used as caller Id in the flashCall. The number that you specify needs to be a number that you have rented from the Sinch portal. DialTimeout should be specified in seconds and must be between 5 and 120. FlashCallOptions object can be specified optionally, and only if the verification request was triggered from your backend (no SDK client) through an [Application signed request](doc:authorization#section-application-signed-request).

By default you do not need to specify what CLI and dial time out to use. Sinch will pick a random CLI and optimize dial time out for your flashCall.

*Example* - FlashCall

```text
[POST] https://verificationapi-v1.sinch.com/verification/v1/verifications
```

```json
{
    "identity": { "type":"number", "endpoint":"+46700000000" },
    "method": "flashCall"
}
```

*Example* - FlashCall specifying CLI (no SDK scenario)

```text
[POST] https://verificationapi-v1.sinch.com/verification/v1/verifications
```

```json
Request
{
    "identity": { "type":"number", "endpoint":"+46700000000" },
    "method": "flashCall",
    "flashCallOptions":{"cli":"+1234567890", "dialTimeout":10}
}
```

*Example* - Sms

```text
[POST] https://verificationapi-v1.sinch.com/verification/v1/verifications
```

```json
{
    "identity": { "type":"number", "endpoint":"+46700000000" },
    "method": "sms"
}
```

*Example* - Callout

```text
[POST] https://verificationapi-v1.sinch.com/verification/v1/verifications
```

```json
{
    "identity": { "type":"number", "endpoint":"+46700000000" },
    "method": "callout"
}
```

### Response

    [RequestBody]
        VerificationResponse
    
    [VerificationResponse]
        string - id
        SmsVerificationData? - sms
        FlashCallVerificationData? - flashCall
        CalloutVerificationData? - callout
    
    [SmsVerificationData]
        string - template
    
    [FlashCallVerificationData]
        string - cliFilter
        int - interceptionTimeout
    
    [CalloutVerificationData]
        int - startPollingAfter
        int - stopPollingAfter
        int - pollingInterval

The response from the Sinch Verification service differs, depending on the verification method.

In case of a flashcall request, the response contains the following parameters:

**cliFilter** is the filter that should be applied for incoming calls to intercept the flashcall.

**interceptionTimeout** indicates the amount of seconds that the SDK client will be waiting for the flashcall.

*Example* - FlashCall

```json
{
    "id":"1234567876",
    "flashCall":{"cliFilter":"(.*)70123(.*)","interceptionTimeout":120}
}
```

In case of an SMS verification, the response contains the **template** of the SMS to be expected and intercepted.

*Example* - Sms

```json
{
    "id": "1234567890",
    "sms": { "template": "Your verfication code is {{CODE}}" }
}
```

In case of a callout verification (voice call), the response contains information for the client to poll for the verification result.

*Example* - Callout

```json
{
    "id": "1234567890",
    "callout":{
        "startPollingAfter":3,
        "stopPollingAfter":30,
        "pollingInterval":3
        }
}
```

## Report Verification

**\[PUT\] /verifications/{type}/{endpoint}** - Report back on a started verification

After the SMS or flashcall is received (and intercepted, in case of Android), the client needs to report to the Sinch Verification service either the PIN (for SMS) or CLI (for flashCall).

### Authorization

Authorization level can be specified in the Sinch dashboard, under your app settings. By default it is set to "Deny". If you are using this API to report a verification from your backend, you should use an [Application signed request](doc:authorization#section-application-signed-request).

### Request

    [RequestBody]
        VerficationReportRequest
    
    [VerficationReportRequest]
        string - method
        SmsVerificationReportData? - sms
        FlashCallVerificationReportData? - flashCall
    
    [SmsVerificationReportData]
        string - code
        string? - cli
    
    [FlashCallVerificationReportData]
        string - cli

**method** indicates the verification method. Possible values are:

  - flashCall
  - sms

**code** indicates the PIN code that was inputted by the user in the app

**cli** indicates the caller Id of the flashCall or the sender Id of the SMS.

*Example* - FlashCall

```text
[PUT] https://verificationapi-v1.sinch.com/verification/v1/verifications/number/+46700000000
```

```json
{
    "method": "flashCall",
    "flashCall": { "cli": "+46000000000" }
}
```

*Example* - SMS

```text
[PUT] https://verificationapi-v1.sinch.com/verification/v1/verifications/number/+46700000000
```

```json
{
    "method": "sms",
    "sms": { "code": "123" }
}
```

The Sinch Verification backend will then validate the reported PIN or CLI and respond with success or failure.

**Important** 

This endpoint can only be used for a limited time after the verification request.

---

## Set SMS language

It is possible to specify the content language for SMS verification. The desired language is set in the initiate verification request 'Accept-Language' header. Setting this header is optional. If not included the application's default SMS content language is used, which by default is en-US. If an SMS template for the desired language is not found it is defaulted to 'en-US' unless a different default language has been defined for the requesting application.
 More information on the 'Accept-Language' header can be found from [IETF](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3282) and the [HTTP/1.1 documentation](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.4).

---
**Note** 

The content language specified in the API request or in the callback can be overridden by carrier provider specific templates, due to complience and legal requirements, such as [US shortcode requirements (pdf)](https://www.wmcglobal.com/storage/us_resources/ctia-short-code-monitoring-handbook-current-Short-Code-Monitoring-Handbook-v1.7.pdf).

---

*Example* - SMS verification specifying content language

    Headers:
    ...
    Accept-Language: es-ES
    ...
    
    [POST] https://verificationapi-v1.sinch.com/verification/v1/verifications

```json    
{
    "identity": { "type":"number", "endpoint":"+46700000001" },
    "method": "sms"
}
```

The actual language that was selected is returned in the 'Content-Language' HTTP content header. As outlined above, this may differ from the requested language due to either that language not having SMS content defined, or it being overridden by provider requirements.

*Example* - SMS verification response with selected content language

#### Response

    Headers:
    ...
    Content-Length: 103
    Content-Language: es-ES
    Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
    Expires: -1
    ...

```json
{
    "id":"1087388",
    "sms":
        {
            "template":"Tu código de verificación es {{CODE}}.",
            "interceptionTimeout":120
        }
}
```
